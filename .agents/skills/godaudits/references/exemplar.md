# Exemplar module: the quality bar, worked

Loaded whenever quality is in doubt, and always before Phase 5 scoring. Four audit fragments, each shown twice: the version that fails and the version that ships. The difference is always the same difference: the bad version could have been written without reading the codebase; the good version pins itself to this repo, this commit, this line, and could belong to no other audit.

## 1. A finding block

**Never produce this:**

```markdown
#### F-SEC-1 Weak input validation

The API does not properly validate user input in several places, which
could lead to security vulnerabilities. Input validation should be
improved across the codebase.
```

No severity triple, no Where, no Evidence, no fix, no task. "Several places" and "could lead to" survive substitution into any repo ever audited. A remediating agent holding only this block must re-run the audit before it can act.

**This is the bar:**

```markdown
#### F-SEC-4 Auth callback follows an unvalidated redirect [High | Certain | S]

- Where: src/auth/callback.ts:52
- Evidence: `res.redirect(req.query.next as string)` runs with no origin
  check; the login form passes `next` through untouched
  (src/pages/login.tsx:31)
- Impact: a crafted login link lands a freshly authenticated user on an
  attacker page with a live session; an open redirect as a phishing pivot
- Fix: validate `next` against the same-origin allowlist in
  src/config/origins.ts inside callback.ts; fall back to `/dashboard`
- Verify the fix: `npm test -- tests/security/redirect.test.ts`
- Checks: A-SEC-4
- Status: open
- Remediation: GA-102
```

## 2. A scorecard row

**Never produce this:**

```markdown
| Security | 78 | Generally solid security posture with some room for improvement |
```

78 is a vibe wearing a number. No cap, no finding named, and the reason fits every domain of every audit ever written.

**This is the bar:**

```markdown
| Security | 69 (cap) | Weighted 81, capped at 69: F-SEC-3 (Critical, cross-tenant reads) is open. F-SEC-3 and F-SEC-4 cost 30 of 40 access-control points; secrets and headers dimensions are clean. |
```

The score shows its arithmetic: the uncapped number, the rule that capped it, and the finding ids that did the damage. When `F-SEC-3` flips to resolved, a reader can recompute the row without re-auditing.

## 3. A remediation task

**Never produce this:**

```markdown
- [ ] GA-201 Improve API security
  - Acceptance: the API is secure and validated
  - Verify: review the changes carefully
```

No Files, no Fixes line, an acceptance no grep can test, a verify step that names nothing. Untraceable to any finding, unexecutable by any agent, uncheckable by any human.

**This is the bar:**

```markdown
- [ ] GA-102 [W1.1] Validate the auth callback redirect target
  - Files: src/auth/callback.ts, tests/security/redirect.test.ts
  - Depends on: none
  - Reuses: same-origin allowlist from src/config/origins.ts; do not
    hardcode a second list
  - Fixes: F-SEC-4
  - Acceptance: `next` values off the allowlist redirect to `/dashboard`;
    a request with `next=https://evil.example` returns 302 to
    `/dashboard`; the allowlist import comes from src/config/origins.ts
  - Verify: `npm test -- tests/security/redirect.test.ts`
  - Checks: A-SEC-4
```

The Fixes line closes the loop: finding `F-SEC-4` names `GA-102` as its remediation, `GA-102` names `F-SEC-4` as its reason to exist, and both carry the same Verify command. Flip the box, resolve the finding, and the frontmatter counters move in the same edit.

## 4. A strengths entry

**Never produce this:**

```markdown
- Good code quality overall; the team clearly cares about testing.
```

Flattery with no coordinates. It tells the remediating agent nothing to preserve and the reader nothing they can confirm.

**This is the bar:**

```markdown
- Reversible migrations, enforced: all 41 files under db/migrations/
  ship a paired `down()`, and CI blocks merges without one via
  `npm run migrate:lint` (.github/workflows/ci.yml:38). Remediation
  tasks GA-301 and GA-303 touch this directory; keep the pairing intact.
```

A strength is a finding with the sign flipped: same evidence standard, same file:line, plus the warning that tells a remediating agent what not to break while executing nearby tasks.

## The pattern under all four

1. Name the thing: real file:line, real ids, real commands, never the category of the thing.
2. Quote the evidence: a finding without quotable evidence is a hypothesis, and a strength without evidence is flattery.
3. Make failure detectable: every claim carries the check, command, or cap rule that would catch its violation.
4. End in a checkbox: every Critical and High finding traces to a GA task an agent can execute, verify, and flip.

## The final prose pass

Before rendering, read every authored title, impact, fix, strength, destination,
and summary once without the evidence blocks. Ask what actor acts, what mechanism
changes, and what observable result follows. Rewrite any sentence that answers
none of those questions.

Remove unsupported attribution, puffery, promotional formulas, filler, stacked
hedging, chatbot residue, and generic conclusions. Inspect passive voice,
contentless participial clauses, dense sentences, adverbs, formulaic contrasts,
and synonym cycling in context. Those forms are review prompts, not automatic
defects. Keep a technical term when it is the precise name of the thing, and keep
the headings, colons, lists, and repeated vocabulary that make the report contract
stable.

Do not claim that a phrase establishes AI authorship. The defect is concrete:
the sentence is unsupported, non-specific, difficult to parse, or addressed to
the wrong reader. Name that defect and cite the source.

Severity follows blast radius, not visibility. A defect trivial to spot but that no check covered is not a smaller finding for being obvious; it carries the severity its reach earns.

Score any audit fragment against these four. A fragment that names nothing, quotes nothing, and checks nothing scores zero, no matter how alarming its warnings or how reassuring its praise.
