# Audit state and report contract

godaudits 2.1 separates machine state from presentation while keeping 2.0 audit documents valid:

- `.godaudits/AUDIT.json` is the canonical, schema-versioned source of truth.
- `.godaudits/AUDIT.mdx` is a generated standalone human and agent report.
- `.godaudits/AUDIT.sarif` is optional generated code-host integration output.
- `.godaudits/EVIDENCE.json` is the deterministic static fingerprint and signal
  inventory. Signals are leads, not findings.

Never hand-edit computed fields, MDX, or SARIF. Edit audit state, compile it,
validate it, and regenerate the views.

## Why JSON is canonical

The v1 MDX format mixed human prose, mutable state, counters, scores, evidence,
and task links in one document. Grep could check surface shape but could not
prove arithmetic, reciprocal links, task dependency acyclicity, catalog
coverage, evidence types, or pack freshness. JSON provides typed state. The
bundled runtime performs semantic validation and produces deterministic views.

The formal schema is `schemas/audit.schema.json`. Runtime validation is
stricter than JSON Schema where cross-record relationships or arithmetic are
involved.

## Initialization

After intake determines name, archetype, scale, and applicability, initialize
the state from the generated catalog:

```bash
godaudits init --name PROJECT --archetype ARCHETYPE --scale SCALE --profile PROFILE --applicable all --evidence .godaudits/EVIDENCE.json --output .godaudits/AUDIT.json
```

Focused audits pass a comma-separated domain list. The initializer writes all
18 applicability rows and every selected domain's complete check ledger. Every
check begins as `unknown`. That state is intentionally honest and scores zero
coverage until evaluated.

## Metadata contract

`audit` records:

- `name`, `audit_version`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, and `mode`.
- `plan_aware`, audited `commit`, `archetype`, `scale`, and `risk_profile`.
- `budget`: `medium` selects screening checks while deep-trace checks remain
  unknown in the complete ledger; `full` selects both cost tiers. New audits
  default to medium. Its unknowns lower compiled coverage.
- Optional `project_form`, `secondary_forms`, and `domain_overlays` preserve the four-axis intake result while `archetype` remains the compatibility field.
- Optional `evidence_fingerprint_sha256` and `evidence_commit` bind the audit to the evidence snapshot. Release and re-audit gates require them.
- `engine_version` and `pack_version`.
- `capabilities`: static, plus explicitly authorized sandbox or connected
  evidence capabilities.
- `assumptions`: only facts the repository could not answer.
- Optional `destination`: one or two sentences of prose naming what reaching
  the end of the remediation plan looks like. It fixes the scope, so a
  remediating session reads it before choosing a task. The final re-audit
  gate's acceptance conditions are its machine-checkable form; the prose says
  why that gate is the right end.

The compiler writes `computed`: coverage, domain scores, caps, overall score,
verdict, and counters. Computed state is derived and may always be rebuilt.
The frontier is deliberately not computed into that block: it changes every
time a task closes, so it is derived on demand by `godaudits wayfind` and can
never be committed stale.

## Standards ledger

The optional `standards` array records framework, category, title, disposition, mapped checks, evidence, and finding ids. Version 2.1 initialization emits all ten OWASP Web Top 10:2025 categories. A category may be pass, fail, unknown, or not-applicable. Pass, fail, and not-applicable require evidence; fail also requires a finding. Standards checks do not add score. They expose coverage and route defects to the existing weighted owning checks.

## Evidence grammar

Evidence records have stable `E-n` ids and one of five types.

### Source evidence

Required: path, positive line, quote, file SHA-256, and `redacted`. Add a symbol
when available. The hash pins the quote to repository content and makes moved
or changed evidence detectable during re-audit.

### Absence evidence

Required: exact command or query, search scope, zero-hit result in `quote`, and
`redacted`. Absence evidence replaces fake file-line citations for missing CI,
missing tests, missing authorization layers, or missing documentation.

### Tool evidence

Required: tool name, tool version, exact command, normalized result, and
provenance. Import scanner output as evidence; do not copy a scanner conclusion
directly into a finding without tracing reachability and ownership.

Use `godaudits import-sarif scanner.sarif` to normalize SARIF 2.1.0 results, or
`godaudits import-tool REPORT --tool TOOL --command "COMMAND"` for SARIF,
Semgrep, ast-grep, Gitleaks, and OSV-Scanner JSON. Supply `--tool-version` when
the report does not embed it. Select a non-conflicting starting evidence id
with `--start` before merging the records into AUDIT.json. Imported messages
and command lines pass through secret masking and remain evidence leads, never
automatic findings. Gitleaks secret values never enter output; only a short
one-way fingerprint is retained for correlation.

### Runtime evidence

Allowed only under an explicitly recorded sandbox or connected capability.
Required: environment, tool, version, command or manual path, result, timestamp
or immutable artifact id, and isolation constraints.

### Human evidence

Required: who supplied it, date, exact decision or answer, and whether it is an
assumption, authorization statement, accepted risk, or open-question decision.

### Secret-safe evidence

Never quote a credential value. Replace it with a masked marker containing a
short one-way fingerprint. Set `sensitive: true` and `redacted: true`. Runtime
validation blocks evidence explicitly marked sensitive but not redacted.

## Check ledger grammar

Every applicable catalog check has exactly one record:

```json
{
  "id": "A-SEC-3",
  "outcome": "fail",
  "confidence": "Certain",
  "weight": 6,
  "evidence": ["E-12", "E-13"],
  "finding_ids": ["F-SEC-1"]
}
```

Rules:

- `pass`: evidence proves the control or property holds.
- `fail`: evidence proves a defect and at least one finding records it.
- `unknown`: evidence is insufficient. Unknown never earns points and reduces
  coverage. An unknown check may carry an optional `question`: the precise
  question whose answer resolves it. The question is what makes an unknown
  takeable instead of merely uncounted, so record one wherever the gap is
  describable. It is rejected on any other outcome, where it would restate a
  question already answered.
- `not-applicable`: the check's conditional surface is absent and evidence
  proves the absence.
- Confidence is Certain, Firm, or Tentative.
- Weight comes from `catalog/checks.json` and cannot be edited. Conditional
  checks drop out through `not-applicable`; remaining weights normalize during
  computation.
- Routing checks have zero direct weight. A routing failure must map its
  finding to the weighted owning check affected by the defect.
- A pass cannot reference findings. An open finding cannot reference a passing
  check.

## Finding grammar

Findings keep stable ids forever:

```json
{
  "id": "F-SEC-1",
  "domain": "security",
  "title": "Board lookup omits the tenant predicate",
  "severity": "Critical",
  "confidence": "Certain",
  "effort": "S",
  "evidence": ["E-12", "E-13"],
  "impact": "An authenticated user can read another tenant board by id.",
  "fix": "Add the tenant predicate inside the board query.",
  "verify": "node --test test/security.test.js",
  "checks": ["A-SEC-3"],
  "status": "open",
  "remediation": ["GA-101"]
}
```

Rules:

- Ids are `F-<DOM>-n`, sequential inside the domain and never reused.
- Severity is Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
- Confidence is Certain, Firm, or Tentative.
- Effort is S, M, or L.
- Evidence must be sufficient to confirm the claim without relying on chat.
- Impact names a user, operator, security, reliability, or business failure.
- Fix names a concrete safe pattern and real locations.
- Verify is one exact command or manual path.
- Checks include every failed check this root cause affects. Routing checks also
  include the weighted owner.
- Status is open, resolved, accepted-risk, or superseded.
- Finding and task remediation links are reciprocal.
- Titles, impact, fixes, destination prose, and summaries name the actor,
  mechanism, location, or observable result. Remove unsupported attribution,
  puffery, promotional formulas, filler, stacked hedging, chatbot residue, and
  generic conclusions. Do not weaken required technical terms or report
  structure to satisfy a word list.

## Strength grammar

A strength carries title, evidence ids, and a `preserve` sentence telling the
remediating agent what must not regress. Strengths use the same evidence bar as
findings. Flattery is invalid.

## Remediation task grammar

```json
{
  "id": "GA-101",
  "phase": 1,
  "wave": "1.1",
  "title": "Scope board lookups to the tenant",
  "parallel": false,
  "files": ["src/boards.js", "test/security.test.js"],
  "depends_on": [],
  "reuses": "central authorization middleware",
  "fixes": ["F-SEC-1"],
  "acceptance": [
    "Every board query contains a tenant predicate.",
    "A cross-tenant lookup returns 404."
  ],
  "verify": "node --test test/security.test.js",
  "checks": ["A-SEC-3"],
  "status": "open",
  "claim": { "owner": "remediation-session-a", "claimed": "2026-07-31" }
}
```

Rules:

- Ids are stable `GA-nnn` values.
- Parallel tasks must have disjoint files and no hidden shared state.
- Dependencies must exist, point backward in phase order, and form a DAG.
- Every non-final task fixes at least one finding.
- Critical and High findings have at least one task.
- Acceptance has 2 to 4 observable conditions.
- Finding-task links are reciprocal.
- The one active final re-audit task depends on every active non-final task.
- Optional `claim`: `{ "owner": "...", "claimed": "YYYY-MM-DD" }`. A session
  claims a task before starting work so a concurrent session skips it. An open
  unclaimed task is free to take. A claim is rejected on a task that is no
  longer open, where it would read as work in flight that is not.

## Wayfinding: the plan as a map

The task graph already carries a route. `godaudits wayfind AUDIT.json` reads it
as one, and reports what the phase-and-wave listing cannot:

- **Destination.** `audit.destination` plus the final gate's acceptance
  conditions. Read before choosing a task.
- **Frontier.** The open tasks whose every dependency is closed, and which no
  session has claimed. Superseded counts as closed: a replaced task will never
  complete, so waiting on it would strand its dependents. The final gate is the
  destination rather than a member of the route, so it is excluded from the
  blocked list and from every task's unblock count.
- **Not yet specified.** In scope and unresolved. Unknown checks are questions
  the catalog phrases precisely and this audit left unanswered. The optional
  root `not_yet_specified` array holds the dimmer view: `{ domain, gist,
  revisit_when?, checks? }` for a lead this audit can see but cannot yet phrase
  as a check. Its domain must be applicable, because fog only gathers toward
  the destination, and its named checks must still be unknown, because fog that
  graduated into a resolved check is cleared rather than restated.
- **Out of scope.** Excluded domains with their reason, and not-applicable
  checks with their evidence. Scope, not sharpness, lands work here. It never
  graduates inside this audit and never enters the remediation route; redrawing
  the scope is a fresh audit, not a resumption.

Refer by name, never by a bare id. A wall of ids is illegible, so the rendered
report writes each task and finding reference as its title with the id inside
it. Check ids stay bare: their titles live in the catalog rather than in
AUDIT.json, and the plan-aware mirror already uses that slot for the R-id.

## Accepted risks and open questions

An accepted risk requires finding id, summary, named owner, acceptance date,
expiry date, and review command. The linked finding status is `accepted-risk`.
No permanent ownerless waivers.

An open question requires question, owner, due date, and recommended default.
Questions that block applicability or severity remain visible and prevent a
false full-coverage claim.

## Deterministic scoring

The catalog compiler translates each module's scoring dimensions into per-check
weights. The audit compiler calculates scores from outcomes:

- Pass earns the check weight.
- Failed Low earns 75 percent of the check weight.
- Failed Medium earns 50 percent.
- Failed High earns 25 percent.
- Failed Critical earns zero.
- Unknown earns no points and is excluded from the quality denominator while
  reducing coverage.
- Not-applicable drops the check and its weight.

The domain score is the normalized weighted result. Overall is the intake
weighted mean of applicable domains. Then apply caps:

- Active Critical, including accepted risk: owning domain at 69, overall at 79.
- Any domain below 50: overall at 84.
- Coverage 80 to 94: overall at 89.
- Coverage 60 to 79: overall at 79.
- Coverage below 60: overall at 69.

Verdict bands remain: 90-100 audit-proof, 80-89 solid, 70-79 needs work,
50-69 at risk, 0-49 critical condition. A score without coverage is invalid.

## Compile, validate, and render

```bash
godaudits validate .godaudits/AUDIT.json --repo . --require-fresh-evidence --write
godaudits render .godaudits/AUDIT.json --output .godaudits/AUDIT.mdx
godaudits sarif .godaudits/AUDIT.json --output .godaudits/AUDIT.sarif
godaudits wayfind .godaudits/AUDIT.json
```

`wayfind` is a read, never a write. It compiles nothing and mutates nothing, so
it stays correct on a half-written plan and immediately after a task status
changes. Flags are space-separated: `--format text|json` and `--output file`.

Validation checks structure plus cross-record semantics: catalog completeness,
pack version, ids, evidence, weights, check outcomes, finding closure,
reciprocal links, dependency cycles, final-gate closure, accepted-risk expiry
shape, compliance ownership, parallel file isolation, session-log size, scores,
counters, standards coverage, evidence freshness, and secret redaction. `not-applicable` requires absence evidence.
Certain Critical and High findings require two independent evidence paths, and so
does a Certain pass on a weighted check: certainty costs corroboration whether the
claim raises an alarm or clears a check. Two quotes from the same file are one
method, not two.

The detector-regression corpus (`npm run test:detectors`) is internal and gates
one thing: whether seeded defects are still detected after a catalog change. Each
case declares its provenance. An `authored` case is a maintainer-built fixture
that detects its own seed by construction, so it earns regression coverage and
may never contribute to a detection rate; only a `recorded` real audit run may,
and only above a floor of independent audits, carrying the provenance and limits
in its `attribution` block (no control arm, small fixtures, model and harness not
captured). The corpus estimates nothing about unseen repositories, and no number
it produces reaches a per-repo score.

The renderer produces GFM-safe MDX: no JSX, ESM, bare MDX expressions, non-ASCII
punctuation, or unescaped evidence. It expands every evidence record so pass and
not-applicable support can be checked from the standalone report. The
remediation plan leads with the destination and the frontier, because both are
read before a task is chosen, and reports fog and scope in separate sections so
a coverage gap never reads as a deliberate boundary. Task and finding
references render as a title carrying the id. SARIF 2.1.0
carries check ids, severity, finding metadata, and source locations for
code-host annotations.

## Rules for remediating agents

The generated report contains a compact form of these rules:

1. AUDIT.json is the source of truth; chat and generated views are not.
2. Work in phase and wave order. Respect dependencies.
3. Run Verify before setting a task done or finding resolved.
4. Change reciprocal task, finding, check, counters, and updated date through
   the compiler in one state transition.
5. Failed verification leaves the task open and adds a dated session note.
6. Never renumber or delete historical findings or completed tasks.
7. Claim a task before starting work and release the claim when it closes, so a
   concurrent session skips it rather than duplicating it.
8. Re-derive the frontier with `godaudits wayfind` after each close. A rendered
   report can be older than the task state; the map cannot.
7. Patch the audit first when the true fix differs materially from the task.
8. Regenerate MDX and SARIF after state changes.
9. Finish with the final re-audit gate and record the score plus coverage delta.

## Size and archive discipline

AUDIT.json may retain history but the live MDX view stays concise: verdict under
120 words, at most 12 root-cause findings per domain, at most 12 tasks per phase,
under 10 active risks or questions, and session summaries under 140 characters.
Archive prior JSON and MDX together under `.godaudits/archive/` before pruning a
large live view. Never delete ids from machine history.

## Re-audit protocol

1. Copy the prior compiled JSON and MDX into the archive.
2. Re-run static evidence at the new commit.
3. Re-evaluate every open finding and every check affected by the diff and its
   reverse-dependency blast radius.
4. Preserve ids. Resolve with new evidence; never erase history.
5. Continue finding and task sequences for new work.
6. Compile and validate both versions.
7. Run `godaudits diff previous.json current.json` and include added, resolved,
   reopened, changed, removed-id defects, and score delta in the report.
8. Bump `audit_version`, update the date, and append the session log.

A removed historical finding or task id is a re-audit defect and makes the diff
command exit nonzero. A moved source location updates through new hashed
evidence without changing the finding id.

The diff also rolls up `tasks.closures`: one entry per completed task carrying
its `fixes` list and a `closure` of `all-resolved`, `partly-open`,
`none-resolved`, or `no-linked-findings`, computed only from open-to-resolved
finding transitions. This is auditor-asserted closure that ties a score move to
the remediation that earned it, never an observed runtime outcome, and it is not
joined to check outcomes because one check can carry findings that a single task
does not fully resolve. No rate is derived from it.
