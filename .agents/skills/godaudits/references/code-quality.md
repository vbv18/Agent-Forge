# Code quality audit module

Audits the maintainability core of a codebase: layering conventions in the code, quality budgets, typing strictness, test quality, error handling, performance shapes, dependency hygiene, docs drift, and code-level operability hooks. Emits findings `F-CODE-n` and a 0-100 domain score into AUDIT.json and its generated AUDIT.mdx view. The orchestrator loads it in the domain-pass phase for every repo that ships application code. No archetype may exclude it: per intake.md, code-quality is never excluded, it scales down with the calibration instead, and the applicability matrix records the scale applied.

## Lineage

Descends from codeauditor, the read-only end-of-project auditor that scores nine weighted dimensions (SEC 20, ARC 15, QUAL 15, TEST 15, ERR 10, PERF 8, DEP 7, DOC 5, OBS 5) and hunts paper constructs: uncalled validators, assertion-free tests, unconditional-200 health checks. godplans inverted those checks into plan obligations R-CODE-1 through 22; this module runs them forward against real code, one A-id per R-id. The method DNA carries over intact: evidence over assertion with `file:line` on every claim, the substitution test on every sentence, adversarial refutation before recording, root-cause clustering (twelve empty catches are one systemic finding), calibration to declared maturity, and the hard cap, because risk never averages away. The SEC dimension does not carry over: the security domain owns it, and this module cross-references F-SEC where the lenses touch.

## Surface map

Inventory before any check runs. The intake fingerprint already records stack, manifests, entry points, module layout, and test-and-CI reality; cite it, do not re-scan.

- Quality tooling: `eslint.config.js` or `.eslintrc*`, `ruff.toml`, `.golangci.yml`, `tsconfig.json`, `mypy.ini`, format configs.
- Test surface: `tests/`, `**/*.test.*`, `**/*_test.go`, `conftest.py`, snapshot dirs, coverage config in manifest or CI.
- Dependency surface: manifest plus lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `poetry.lock`, `go.sum`, `Cargo.lock`), CI audit steps.
- Error and I/O sites: catch and except blocks, error middleware mounts, shared HTTP and DB client constructors, retry loops.
- Operability hooks: the logger module, `/health` or `/ready` routes, `.env.example`, Dockerfile and build scripts.
- Convention records: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `agents/` pillars.

Conditional sub-surfaces, each declared present or absent with the reason recorded: the test suite (whole-suite absence is F-REPO's existence concern, cross-referenced, while A-CODE-8 through 10 score the quality of whatever tests exist), the service surface (absent on pure libraries: the performance and operability dimensions re-normalize), and coverage machinery (absent alongside a badge is A-CODE-11).

## Checks

Severities are funded-product calibration; the intake scale moves them, never the evidence.

Mirror boundary: A-CODE-1..22 mirror R-CODE-1..22 one to one; A-CODE-23 and up are audit-only. Cross-verified against godplans: R-CODE-1..24 defined.

1. A-CODE-1: A maturity and deployment-context declaration exists and the code's quality bars match it.
   Look: `README.md` status lines, `docs/`, and in plan-aware mode the `.godplans/PLAN.mdx` objective; intake scale signals.
   Fail: no discoverable declaration while deploy workflows show real users, or bars contradicting the declaration: Medium.
2. A-CODE-2: Layering holds in code: one dependency direction, no layer-skipping imports.
   Look: the import graph from entry points; grep for ORM or DB client imports inside `src/routes/`, `src/components/`, `src/pages/`.
   Fail: presentation or transport importing persistence directly: High.
3. A-CODE-3: Similar features are built the same way, copying one canonical shape.
   Look: three sibling endpoints or handlers of the same kind; compare validation, error, and response shape.
   Fail: each sibling reinvents the shape: Medium, clustered as one systemic finding.
4. A-CODE-4: Abstraction fits the problem: repeated logic shares a helper, no speculative indirection.
   Look: near-duplicate blocks pasted three or more times; interfaces with one implementation; factories with one product.
   Fail: a copy-paste class of duplicates: Medium; indirection with a single caller and no variation: Low.
5. A-CODE-5: Quality budgets are wired to lint rules: function and file length, nesting depth, parameter count, no magic values, no dead code.
   Look: budget rules in the lint config; grep for functions past 50 lines, files past 400, commented-out blocks, unused exports.
   Fail: no budget rules while hotspots exceed those defaults: Medium; dead code: Low.
6. A-CODE-6: Typing is strict and escape hatches carry an inline reason.
   Look: `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json` or mypy strict flags; grep `: any`, `as unknown as`, `@ts-ignore`, `# type: ignore`.
   Fail: strict mode off where the language supports it: High; unexplained suppressions: Medium.
7. A-CODE-7: Deferred-work markers reference tracked issues.
   Look: grep `TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX` under source dirs; check the hits for issue references.
   Fail: ten or more bare markers: Medium. Stub handlers and fake data behind markers belong to build; cross-reference F-BUILD per the ownership map.
8. A-CODE-8: Every critical path (authn, authz, payments, irreversible mutations) has tests asserting success and at least one failure case.
   Look: map `tests/` files to the auth, payment, and mutation modules the fingerprint names.
   Fail: a critical path with zero tests: High; failure cases untested: Medium.
9. A-CODE-9: Tests assert meaningful outcomes.
   Look: test files containing no `expect(` or `assert`; snapshot-only suites; mocks asserted against themselves.
   Fail: assertion-free or mock-echo tests guarding load-bearing modules: High; elsewhere: Medium.
10. A-CODE-10: Tests are deterministic by construction: injected clock, seeded randomness, no live network, order independence.
    Look: grep `Date.now(`, `new Date(`, `Math.random(`, `time.time(`, and live URLs inside `tests/`.
    Fail: wall clock or live network in tests: Medium. Whether CI runs the suite at all is repo's concern; cross-reference F-REPO.
11. A-CODE-11: Coverage claims match machinery.
    Look: README badges and thresholds against the CI step that computes them.
    Fail: a badge or threshold that no command enforces: Medium (coverage theater).
12. A-CODE-12: Errors propagate with cause to one named boundary; nothing is swallowed.
    Look: grep `catch {}`, `catch (e) {}`, `except: pass`, ignored error returns (`_ = err`); find the error middleware mount.
    Fail: an empty catch on a load-bearing path: High; no single boundary, per-handler improvisation: Medium.
13. A-CODE-13: Outbound I/O carries timeouts and retries back off, both from a shared client.
    Look: HTTP and DB client constructor sites, `timeout` options, hand-rolled retry loops.
    Fail: an outbound call with no timeout on a request path: High; retries without backoff: Medium.
14. A-CODE-14: Multi-step operations cannot half-complete, and resources release on error paths.
    Look: sequential external writes with no compensation; file, lock, or connection acquisition without `finally`, `defer`, or a context manager.
    Fail: a partial multi-system write with no compensation: High; leaked handles on error paths: Medium. Database transaction boundaries are database's; cross-reference F-DB.
15. A-CODE-15: List queries paginate; per-item lookups batch.
    Look: list endpoints returning unbounded `findAll` or `SELECT *`; awaited queries inside loops.
    Fail: an unpaginated list endpoint: Medium. N+1 and missing-index root causes file as F-DB per the ownership map; cross-reference, never re-score.
16. A-CODE-16: Caches state their invalidation, long-lived collections are bounded, hot paths do not block.
    Look: module-level `Map` or dict caches, ever-growing arrays, `readFileSync` or other sync calls inside request handlers.
    Fail: an unbounded cache or collection, or sync I/O on a request path: Medium.
17. A-CODE-17: Dependencies are pinned and scanned: committed lockfile, no floating majors, advisory scanner in CI, one package per job.
    Look: lockfile presence, manifest ranges (`*`, `latest`), the CI audit step, duplicate-purpose packages.
    Fail: no lockfile: High; floating `*` or `latest` ranges: Medium; no advisory step at funded-product scale: Medium.
18. A-CODE-18: Docs match reality: README setup, build, and run commands exist; shipped endpoints, flags, and env vars are documented.
    Look: README commands against manifest scripts; grep `process.env.` and `os.environ` against the configuration docs.
    Fail: a README command that no longer exists, or an undocumented required env var: Medium.
19. A-CODE-19: Code-level observability hooks exist: structured logging at boundaries, a health check exercising a real dependency.
    Look: the logger module; `console.log` or bare `print(` outside it; the `/health` route body.
    Fail: a health check returning 200 unconditionally: High (paper health check); printf logging on a service: Medium. Redaction is security's, stack depth is observe's; cross-reference F-SEC and F-OBS.
20. A-CODE-20: Config lives outside code with per-environment values; the build is reproducible; the run procedure is documented.
    Look: hardcoded hosts, ports, and URLs under `src/`; `.env.example`; Dockerfile and build scripts.
    Fail: environment-specific values hardcoded: Medium. Migrations are database's, the pipeline is deploy's; cross-reference F-DB and F-DEPLOY.
21. A-CODE-21: The repo carries runnable verification entry points: one command each for tests, lint, and typecheck.
    Look: manifest scripts, `Makefile`, `noxfile.py`, `justfile`.
    Fail: no single command runs the suite or lint: Medium. Plan-aware: a checked R-CODE task whose Verify command now fails: High.
22. A-CODE-22: Recorded conventions are enforced, not aspirational: every quality rule stated in `AGENTS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` maps to a config or check.
    Look: convention files against lint, type, and CI configs; grep the code for violations of stated rules.
    Fail: a stated rule with no enforcement and live violations: Medium (paper convention).
23. A-CODE-23 (audit-only): Complexity stays out of load-bearing code: no deep nesting, long parameter lists, or god modules there.
    Look: nesting past depth 4 and functions past 50 lines in files the fingerprint marks load-bearing; one module imported by most others.
    Fail: a hotspot on a load-bearing path: Medium.
24. A-CODE-24 (audit-only): Dependencies are alive: not majors behind, not abandoned, no deprecated APIs in active use.
    Look: manifest versions against known majors; deprecation warnings in code; staleness signals readable offline.
    Fail: an abandoned dependency on a critical path: Medium, Tentative when advisory knowledge cannot be confirmed offline.
25. A-CODE-25 (audit-only): Live controls and lawful state machines: every stored or configured flag meant to gate behavior is actually read on the enforcement path (not only written and displayed), and every lifecycle state machine rejects transitions that release a still-committed resource before its end or that run out of lifecycle order.
    Look: each control flag surfaced in the UI or schema (for example an approval-required, hold, or lock flag) traced to a branch that reads it; the state-transition table and the manual versus automatic transition handlers; whether a transition frees an inventory slot, access grant, or credit hold the entity still holds; whether the same guard the automatic path applies (end time, grace period) is applied on the manual path.
    Fail: a control flag written and displayed but never read to change behavior, or a transition that frees a resource before the entity's end or performs an out-of-lifecycle change: High when it defeats an operator-configured safety or booking control, Medium otherwise.
26. A-CODE-26 (audit-only): Wall-clock correctness: availability, booking windows, recurring schedules, and generated occurrences are computed in the entity's configured timezone rather than the server's UTC, daylight-saving transitions are handled, and the timezone used for computation matches the one used for display.
    Look: date arithmetic on scheduling paths (getUTCDay, getUTCHours, Date.UTC, minute-of-day math) where a per-entity or per-property timezone field exists; whether that timezone is loaded and applied; the display formatter's timezone against the computation's.
    Fail: wall-clock scheduling or availability computed with UTC date math while a configured timezone exists, so slots and generated tasks shift by the offset and drift across daylight saving: Medium (High when it yields accepted-but-invalid bookings or missed operational turnovers).

## Scoring

Dimensions derive from codeauditor's weight table with SEC removed (security owns it) and the remainder re-normalized to 100:

- Architecture conventions: 19 (A-CODE-2, A-CODE-3, A-CODE-4, A-CODE-23)
- Maintainability and budgets: 19 (A-CODE-1, A-CODE-5, A-CODE-6, A-CODE-7, A-CODE-22)
- Testing discipline: 19 (A-CODE-8, A-CODE-9, A-CODE-10, A-CODE-11, A-CODE-21)
- Error handling and resilience: 12 (A-CODE-12, A-CODE-13, A-CODE-14)
- Performance shapes: 10, conditional (A-CODE-15, A-CODE-16); re-normalize for pure libraries with no I/O or service surface
- Dependencies: 9 (A-CODE-17, A-CODE-24)
- Docs and drift: 6 (A-CODE-18)
- Operability hooks: 6, conditional (A-CODE-19, A-CODE-20); re-normalize for non-service archetypes

A-CODE-25 and A-CODE-26 carry no weight of their own: their findings score inside the dimension of the control or path they implicate.

Score each dimension against its findings, weight, and sum. Any active Critical finding, including an accepted risk, caps this domain at 69.

  - Checks: A-CODE-12, A-CODE-13

- [ ] GA-xxx Pin dependencies and add the advisory scanner to CI

  - Verify: `npm test -- --run tests/health.test.ts`
  - Checks: A-CODE-18, A-CODE-19

## Anti-patterns hunted

- Paper constructs: a validator defined but never imported, middleware registered but not mounted on the routes it should guard, a rate limiter that does not limit. Pair every definition with its call or mount site; the unwired artifact is the finding, graded as if the protection were absent.
- The unconditional-200 health check: a `/health` route whose body touches no dependency. Read the route body, not its name; a constant return is High under A-CODE-19 no matter how healthy the code reads.
- Assertion-free testing: test files that execute code and assert nothing, snapshot suites nobody reviews, mocks asserted against themselves. Grep for missing asserts, then read the survivors; count these as missing tests, never as coverage.
- Coverage theater: a badge or threshold with no CI step computing it. Compare the badge to the workflow; the gap is the A-CODE-11 finding.
- Swallow-and-continue: empty catches and ignored error returns copied as an idiom. Cluster every site into one systemic F-CODE finding with the site list in Evidence; twelve leaves are one root.
- Vague findings: "error handling is weak" and any line that survives the substitution test for a different repo. Refused: a finding without `file:line` and quotable evidence is a hypothesis, labeled Tentative or deleted.
- Double-billing: N+1 and index findings belong to database, naming and idiom drift to style-genome, secrets to security, stub handlers to build, CI wiring to repo. Refused: this module cross-references F-DB, F-DNA, F-SEC, F-BUILD, and F-REPO per the ownership map instead of re-scoring them.
- Severity inflation: grading a weekend script on a payment-platform bar, or Critical labels on lint nits. Refused: calibration is stated with its signals, moves severity only, and never touches evidence.
